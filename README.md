# Talos

A simple POC question/answering bot based on [chromadb](https://www.trychroma.com/), [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), and the [distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad) checkpoint.

Talos was a mythological [bronze automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos) that protected Europa (the princess) in Crete against pirates and invaders.

## How to use
0) create a venv: `python3 -m venv ./my-venv/`
1) activate the venv: `. ./my-venv/bin/activate`
2) install packages: `pip3 -r requirements.txt`
3) Download e.g. the [Enchiridion](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45109) as txt or any other books into `./books/`
4) Run `./src/load_books.py`
5) Run `./src/main.py` and ask away

Runs on an i7-1165G7 in battery mode without a GPU, although it takes a few seconds to answer.

## Example

Using the Enchiridion from Epictetus (an ancient stoic) as the source for context, I ran the script and got the following:

![The model answering the question of the meaning of life as being escaping into the sphere of stoic freedom, that freedom is morals, and that morals is to praise the austerity of life and of the control of passions](./images/meaning_of_life.png)

Given that the text is a translation from ancient greek in not very modern english it could be worse, but can be improved.

## TODO

- Improve answers with a better model: tune it
- Improve performance
